Web based map using Leaflet Truesize for visualizing different geographic regions next to others.
Essentially a clone of TrueSizeOf; however, I'd like to focus on adding cities and other smaller
geographic units/subdivisions to allow people to see how their city compares to others.

Inspired by a conversation with friends from Houston and Pasadena who wanted to see their cities
juxtaposed against Boston/Cambridge, so these were the first two geometries added to this project!
